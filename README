To run the presentation you need to compile the libProcess library in the experimental directory

Run the presentation with something like:

qmlscene talk720.qml

In the presentation:

SPACE - transition to next slide
LEFT/RIGHT cursor - jump to previous/next slide
TAB - focus on text editor in live coding slide
ESCAPE - Exit slides (except in text editor when lose focus)
F1 - Make text editor hidden
F12 - Make terminal window (dis)appear

This will all run on Raspberry Pi if you build Qt5 for that.
See http://qt-project.org/wiki/RaspberryPi for instructions.
